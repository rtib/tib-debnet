#
# [*allows*] - array
#   Adds an allow- entry to the interface stanza.
#
# [*pre_ups*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run prior to bringing this interface up.
#
# [*ups*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run after bringing this interface up.
#
# [*downs*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run prior to bringing this interface down.
#
# [*post_downs*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run after bringing this interface down.
#
# [*aux_ops*] - hash
#  Hash of key-value pairs with auxiliary options for this interface.
