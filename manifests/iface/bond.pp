# == Define: iface::bond
#
# Resource to define a bonding interface configuration stanza within
# interfaces(5).
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*ifname*] => *(namevar)* - string
#   Name of the interface to be configured.
#
# [*method*] - string
#   Configuration method to be used.
#
# [*auto*] - bool
#   Sets the interface on automatic setup on startup. This is affected by
#   ifup -a and ifdown -a commands.
#
# [*allows*] - array
#   Adds an allow- entry to the interface stanza.
#
# [*family*] - string
#   Address family. Currently, only inet family is supported. Support for
#   inet6 is comming soon.
#
# [*order*] - int
#   Order of the entry to be created in /etc/network/interfaces. Innate
#   odering is preset with default value of 10 for loopback and 20 for dhcp
#   and static stanzas. The order attribute of the resource is added to the
#   default value.
#
# [*hwaddress*] - string
#   The MAC address of the interface. This value is validated as standard
#   IEEE MAC address of 6 bytes, written hexadecimal, delimited with
#   colons (:) or dashes (-).
#
# [*hostname*] - string
#   The hostname to be submitted with dhcp requests.
#
# [*leasetime*] - int
#   The requested leasetime of dhcp leases.
#
# [*vendor*] - string
#   The vendor id to be submitted with dhcp requests.
#
# [*client*] - string
#  The client id to be submitted with dhcp requests.
#
# [*metric*] - int
#  Routing metric for routes added resolved on this interface.
#
# [*address*] - string
#  IP address formatted as dotted-quad for IPv4.
#
# [*netmask*] - string
#  Netmask as dotted-quad or CIDR prefix length.
#
# [*broadcast*] - string
#  Broadcast address as dotted-quad or + or -.
#
# [*gateway*] - string
#  Default route to be brought up with this interface.
#
# [*pointopoint*] - stirng
#  Address of the ppp endpoint as dotted-quad.
#
# [*mtu*] - int
#  Size of the maximum transportable unit over this interface.
#
# [*scope*] - string
#  Scope of address validity. Values allowed are global, link or host.
#
# [*pre_ups*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run prior to bringing this interface up.
#
# [*ups*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run after bringing this interface up.
#
# [*downs*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run prior to bringing this interface down.
#
# [*post_downs*] - array
#  Array of commands to be run after bringing this interface down.
#
# [*aux_ops_*] - hash
#  Hash of key-value pairs with auxiliary options for this interface.
#  To be used by other debnet types only.
#
# [*aux_ops*] - hash
#  Hash of key-value pairs with auxiliary options for this interface.
#  To be used by other debnet types only.
#
# [*tx_queue*] - int
#  Feature helper for setting tx queue on the interface.
#
# [*routes*] - hash
#  Feature helper for setting static routes via the interface.
#
# [*dns_nameserver*] - array
#  Feature helper to add a list of nameservers to be configures via resolvconf
#  while the interface is set up.
#
# [*dns_search*] - array
#  Feature helper to add a list of domain names as dns search via resolvconf
#  while the interface is set up.
